If anyone wants to learn android app development then what will be the pre-requisites?

# The topics you are supposed to look after before starting Android Devleopment

- Master the language
  - Java and XML
    or
  - Kotlin and XML
- Build a strong Base. Gain some problem solving and logic building skill.
- OOPS Concepts
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Knowledge of Application Components
  - Activities
  - Services
  - Content Providers
  - Broadcast Reciever
  - Activating Components
- A good reader
- Be patient
- Good Code Writing Skills
- Pc specifications

## Master the language :

You can Choose either Java or kotlin for the backend. In both case you will use XML as frontend. Both languages are Object-Oriented Programming Language.

```
So Java or Kotlin??
```

### JAVA

**Pros**

- Java is a very old language so one can find too many resources to learn that language, also if you are stuck somewhere you can easily find the solution by googling

- If you are a b.tech or computer science student you have to learn java because it’s in the syllabus. So you can start learning java. and you can also do DSA in JAVA.

- In JAVA you can understand oops concept more easily and deeply and it's a very essential concept to learn foe android dev.

- You can learn the concepts of android dev in JAVA more easily with lots of resources and then can switch to Kotlin.

**Cons**

- You have to write a lot of code
- You have to implement some logics on your own meanwhile Kotlin have inbuilts functions for that.

---

### KOTLIN

**Pros**

- Google declared Kotlin as an official language for android development.

- Most of the companies are switching to Kotlin from java.

- One has to write lesser code in Kotlin compare to java.

- Kotlin has some features that can handle a critical task in very lesser code.

**Cons**

- Less resources than JAVA

- There are not any such disadvantages of Kotlin

_In case you wanna go with JAVA and you wanna do it only for android dev. Some fundamentals of JAVA Programming language include :_

- Packages
- Objects and Classes
- Inheritance and interfaces
- Strings and numbers and generics
- Collections
- Concurrency

## Build the strong base and logic building skills :

_In case you want to start android dev you have to have some good logic building and problem solving skills. For this you can do DSA and solve some problems. It's recomended to learn DSA at first and then you can start any kinda development but you can also do it simultaneously._

## OOPs Concepts

_OOP concepts are the concepts of objects. There are some core concepts in Android. To learn those core concepts you have to have the good understanding of the OOPs concepts. In OOP, there are 4 main concepts means you have to learn._

- Encapsulation :
  _Encapsulation is a way of wrapping up the data in a single unit and prevent the data accessed outside of the wrap._

- Abstraction :
  _Abstraction is a way to hide nonessential information and show only essential ones._

- Inheritance :
  _As you can see its name it’s a way to inherit the properties of other classes. With that, you can use all features of a class to build other classes._

- Polymorphism :
  _As polymorphism means it can uses classes and perform them in different ways. With that, an inherited class can act in different ways._

## Knowledge of Application Components :

_Application components are the essential building blocks of Android app development. Each of the components is a different point by which the system can enter your app. Although each one of them exists as its own entity and plays a specific role, there are some which depend on each other, and not all of them are actual entry points._

_There are five different types of app components each serving a distinct purpose with a distinct life cycle which defines how it is created and destroyed. They include :_

- Activities :
  _This is a component that represents a single screen with a user interface (for instance, an email app may have one activity showing a list of new emails, another activity composing emails, and another one reading emails). Activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in the app. However, each one of them is independent._

- Services :
  _This is a component that runs in the background to perform work for remote processes or long-running operations. It does not provide a user interface (for instance it might play music in the background while the user is in a different app)._

- Content Providers :
  _This is the component that manages a shared set of app data. Through this component, the data that you store either in the file system, on the web, an SQLite database can be queried or even modified (as long as the content provider allows it). This component is also useful for writing and reading data that is not shared and is private to your app._

- Broadcast Recievers :
  _This is the component that responds to system-wide broadcast announcements. Most of the broadcast receivers originate from the system, and although they do not display a user interface, they can create a status bar notification that alerts the user when a broadcast event occurs. Generally, it is a gateway to the other components and it only does minimal work._

- Activating Components :
  _A synchronous message referred to as intent activates 3 of the 4 components (i.e. services, activities, and broadcast receivers). Intents also bind individual components to one another at runtime whether the component belongs to your app or not._

## A good reader :

_You have to be a very good reade because you have to read a lot of documentation and blogs to resolve the errors you will be getting in your app. The official documentations of android is so helpful and as well as vast, so you have to know how to read a documentation to resolve a query. You can also watch video editorials but you will not find video solutions for each and every error and it's recomended to read documentation to gain a in-depth knowledge._

## Be Patient :

_It's pretty much obvious that you have to be patient while you are learning somthing new and so with android development. But in this case you have to be more focused cause sometimes it became so tricky to understand some topics, you may face some serious errors and bugs so you have to be patient to read the whole code you have written to find out the mistake._

## Good code writing Skills :

_You are supposed to work on your code writing skills before jumping into android development. In JAVA the codebase is always big so if you are not able to write good readable code then it may be a hectic task to review the code for the other persons and also for you. To write a good readable code you can prefer these parameters -_

- Use proper variables with good names.
- Give comments where needed
- avoid giving unnecessary comments
- maintain indentation

## Pc Specifications :

_To learn and practice android development one should have a pc or laptop with these specifications -_

- 4gb Ram (you will use android studio and it is a huge software)
- intel i5 or above and in-case of ryzon it's better to have ryzen 4 or 5
- 15.6 inch screen (for big codebases)
- An android device. Beacuse if you run AVD of android studio it will consume a lot of memory. So it is better to run and check on a different device (it must be android).

_You can learn android dev with some least specificationc than i mentioned but if you are able to match those you will learn without any kind of interuption_

## Conclusion

> You have to understand those concepts properly. With these concepts, one can execute his/her ideas to their full potential. If you know the above mentioned points you are good to go unless you have to learn those above-mentioned points to get the best out of learning android development.
